# RightClickHeist
This is a simple program meant to demonstrate the power of spite in programming (and also for an archival project over at glasslibrary.xyz, but spite for me anyways). Turns out NFT people use the term "right-clicker" as some kind of insult to people who don't like NFTs. I love crypto, but NFTs are just plain stupid. In turn, I've made the right click heist.

Run RightClickHeist.py and every .25 seconds an API call will be made to opensea.io for a random asset. Then every file associated with the NFT will be saved to the same folder the script is in. 

If anyone wants me to stop or remove this script to preserve the value of their assets or whatever, I accept bribes at 0xFc05b6F2bb30cC83644136C1c8E6C2f6d44988aA :)
